Current cosmological paradigms suggest that during the Planck epoch and the earliest 
high-energy stages of cosmic evolution, all fundamental forces were unified into a single 
interaction. As the Universe expanded and cooled below critical temperatures, it underwent a sequence 
of phase transitions driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking \cite{CentreTransitions, EarlyAl.}.

In particle physics, the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions into an 
electroweak gauge theory based on $SU(2)\times U(1)$ is well established. Together with Quantum 
Chromodynamics (QCD), the $SU(3)$ theory of strong interactions, this naturally motivates Grand 
Unified Theories (GUTs), in which the Standard Model forces are embedded within a larger simple gauge 
group, $G$ \cite{Kibble1982PhaseUniverse}.

This unification is possible because the strengths of the fundamental forces are not fixed but run 
with energy scale. At higher energies, such as those present in the early Universe, these couplings 
(or, strength of the forces) become more similar, allowing the different forces to behave as a 
single unified interaction at a grand unification scale of order $10^{15}$ GeV ($\sim 10^{-4}$ of 
the Planck mass) \cite{Kibble1982PhaseUniverse}. The subsequent evolution of the Universe therefore 
involved a hierarchy of symmetry-breaking events: first, the breakdown of the GUT symmetry to the 
Standard Model, followed much later by electroweak symmetry breaking at an energy scale of 
approximately $100$ GeV. These transitions represent dramatic changes in the vacuum structure of the 
Universe, analogous to familiar phase changes in condensed-matter systems, and underpin several 
fundamental phenomena, including the generation of particle masses through the Higgs mechanism (see 
Fig. \ref{fig:higgs_broken}) and the emergence of the observed baryon asymmetry through the 
symmetry-breaking mechanisms involving CP violation.


A fundamental constraint governing these transitions is causality; physical effects cannot 
propagate faster than the speed of light, $c$. Consequently, at any given time $t$, regions of the 
Universe separated by a distance greater than the horizon distance $d=ct$ are causally 
disconnected. During a symmetry-breaking phase transition, these isolated regions must 
independently decay into a specific minimum energy state within the vacuum manifold. Due to the 
stochastic nature of this process, causally separated regions often settle into different vacuum 
states, much like crystallizing ice forming misaligned grains.

The boundaries between these misaligned regions manifest as topological defects \cite{CentreDefects}. 
These are stable configurations of energy formed where the vacuum choices of neighboring regions
cannot be smoothly reconciled. In a simplified model with two distinct minima (e.g., positive and 
negative states), a domain wall forms at the interface. In theories, where the vacuum manifold has a complex topology, specifically containing holes or non-contractible loops, the underlying field can wrap around these topological features. This wrapping creates a mismatch in the field's orientation, resulting in stable, linear defects of trapped high energy known as cosmic strings.

The cosmological implications of topological defects are strictly dependent on the specific symmetry 
broken. Defects such as domain walls and magnetic monopoles possess such massive energy densities that 
their existence would dominate the universal energy budget, leading to evolution scenarios that 
contradict observational data; models predicting these are therefore largely ruled out. Conversely, 
cosmic strings are cosmologically viable. They may have served as gravitational ``seeds" for large-
scale structure formation, contributed to anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and 
could potentially account for a portion of the Universe's dark matter \cite{CentreDefects}.

Consequently, topological defects provide a unique observational window 
\cite{Kibble2007Phase-transitionUniverse} into the physics of the extremely early Universe, an energy 
scale inaccessible to terrestrial particle accelerators. However, to rigorously evaluate these scenarios, 
a precise understanding of defect dynamics is required. Before current observations can be used to 
constrain high-energy theory, it is imperative to develop a robust model of how cosmic strings evolve and 
interact throughout cosmic history.
