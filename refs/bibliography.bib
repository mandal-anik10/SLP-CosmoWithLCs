   abstract = {This is a story of a remarkable cross-fertilization of fields. Ideas that originated in speculations about phase transitions in the early universe have led to some very exciting and innovative laboratory experiments on a wide variety of small-scale systems. And although significant puzzles remain, a consistent picture of the dynamics of phase transitions seems to be emerging. The ideas from cosmology stimulated an interest in rapid phase transitions, in constrast to previous work that emphasized ideal near-equilibrium behavior. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

At late times, the density of disclination linesis expected to scale with time as t- with =1. We have measured the scaling exponent to be =1.02±0.09 over the region 16<<160 mm-2. In addition, we have measured the collapse of loops consisting of type-1/2 disclination lines. The loop radius r is expected to scale with time as r(t0-t)±, where ±=1/2 and t0 is the time at which the loop vanishes. We found ± to be 0.50±0.03. © 1991 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Fowler2017,
   abstract = {Symmetry-breaking phase transitions are often accompanied by the formation of topological defects, as in cosmological theories of the early universe, superfluids, liquid crystals or solid-state systems. This scenario is described by the Kibble–Zurek mechanism, which predicts corresponding scaling laws for the defect density ρ. One such scaling law suggests a relation ρ≈τQ−1/2 with τQ the change of rate of a control parameter. In contrast to the scaling of the defect density during annihilation with ρ≈t−1, which is governed by the attraction of defects of the same strength but opposite sign, the defect formation process, which depends on the rate of change of a physical quantity initiating the transition, has only rarely been investigated. Herein, we use nematic liquid crystals as a different system to demonstrate the validity of the predicted scaling relation for defect formation. It is found that the scaling exponent is independent of temperature and material employed, thus universal, as predicted.},

   abstract = {This new edition of this classic text on condensed matter physics includes the great advances that have taken place since its first publication in 1974. New chapters describe the main types and properties of liquid crystals in terms of the new phases discovered since the middle of the 1970's, and advances in the understanding of local order and the nature of the isotropic to nematic transition. There is an extensive discussion of the symmetry, and macroscopic and dynamic properties of smectics and columnar phases, and their defects, illustrated with numerous descriptions of experimental arrangements. The final chapter is devoted to phase transitions in smectics, including the celebrated analogy between Smectic A and superconductors. Throughout the book there is an emphasis on order-of-magnitude considerations. Its topicality and breadth of coverage will ensure that The Physics of Liquid Crystals remains an indispensable guide for students and researchers alike.},

   abstract = {Symmetry breaking phase transitions occurring in the early Universe are expected to leave behind long-lived topologically stable structures such as monopoles, strings or domain walls1-6. Here I discuss the analogy between cosmological strings and vortex lines in the superfluid, and suggest a cryogenic experiment which tests key elements of the cosmological scenario for string formation. In a superfluid obtained through a rapid pressure quench, the phase of the Bose condensate wavefunction - the 4He analogue of the broken symmetry of the field-theoretic vacuum - will be chosen randomly in domains of some characteristic size d. When the quench is performed in an annulus of circumference C the typical value of the phase mismatch around the loop will be ∼(C/d)1/2. The resulting phase gradient can foe sufficiently large to cause the superfluid to flow with a measurable (mm s -1), randomly directed velocity. © 1985 Nature Publishing Group.},

In an expanding universe texture obeys a scaling solution, which produces a constant density perturbation at horizon crossing of /mGUT2/mPlanck2, where mGUT is the scale of symmetry breaking. These (isocurvature) perturbations are broadly of Harrison-Zeldovich form, but are non-Gaussian, having strong spikes in the density field. Consequences for microwave background anisotropy are briefly discussed. © 1989 The American Physical Society.},

It is shown that the formation of domain wall, strings or monopoles depends on the homotopy groups of the manifold of degenerate vacua. The subsequent evolution of these structures is investigated. It is argued that while theories generating domain walls can probably be eliminated (because of their unacceptable gravitational effects), a cosmic network of strings may well have been formed and may have had important cosmological effects.},

   abstract = {Liquid crystals are remarkably useful for laboratory exploration of the dynamics of cosmologically relevant defects. They are convenient to work with, they allow the direct study of the "scaling solution" for a network of strings, and they provide a model for the evolution of monopoles and texture. Experiments described here support the simple "one-scale" model for cosmic string evolution, as well as some qualitative predictions of string statistical mechanics. The structure of monopoles and their apparent cylindrical but not spherical symmetry is discussed. A particular kind of defect known as texture is described and is shown to have a dynamical instability—it can decay into a monopole-antimonopole pair. This decay process has been observed occurring in the liquid crystal, and studied with numerical simulations.},
